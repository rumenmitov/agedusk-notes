- # Backstory
	- From a young age I knew that I was adopted, but that did not stop my parents from loving me as
	  though I was their own.
	- I have only the slightest of ideas about my biological parents. They lived somewhere in the south,
	  but something had threatened their existence, for I was delivered here, to the town of Haerlun, by
	  a mysterious adventurer. All he had said, apparently, was that my name was Scontius Strumvius and that I was in need of a new family.
	- For most of my life, I did not dwell on my biological heritage for I found a sense of belonging in
	  the welcoming community around me.
	  I enrolled in the local wizarding school, for I had always been curious about the inner workings of
	  the universe.
	- Then the dreams came. It was the beginning of my last school year when I began having visions
	  of my biological parents, of the town they lived in. None, of the dreams provided much
	  information, but they conveyed such vehement feelings of fear and panic. These visions began
	  occurring more often than not. It got to the point that I could not rest properly. The day after my
	  graduation, I informed my parents of my plans to seek out the meanings of these visions, for I
	  had a feeling that if I uncovered the truth, the visions would leave me alone.
	- On our parting, my parents gifted me with an old unopened letter given to them from the
	  adventurer who delivered me to Haerlun. The letter came with a signet ring, which bore the same emblem as the one that the letter was stamped with.

	- ## Cantrips
		- **Fire Bolt**
		  collapsed:: true
			- level:: cantrip
			  casting_time:: 1 action
			  range:: 120 feet
			  components:: [[V]], [[S]]
			  duration:: instantaneous
			- You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a 
			  ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 
			  fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn’t 
			  being worn or carried.
			- *At Higher Levels.* This spell’s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).
		- **Minor Illusion**
		  collapsed:: true
			- level:: cantrip
			  casting_time:: 1 action
			  range:: 30 feet
			  components:: [[S]], [[M]]
			  duration:: 1 minute
			- You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts 
			  for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action 
			  or cast this spell again.
			- If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a 
			  scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a 
			  beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues 
			  unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at 
			  different times before the spell ends.
			- If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy 
			  footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. 
			  The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect.
			  Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, 
			  because things can pass through it.
			- If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the 
			  creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful 
			  Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a 
			  creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes 
			  faint to the creature.
		- **Mage Hand**
		  collapsed:: true
			- level:: cantrip
			  casting_time:: 1 action
			  range:: 30 feet
			  components:: [[V]], [[S]]
			  duration:: 1 minute
			- A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range.
			  The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. 
			  The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if 
			  you cast this spell again.
			- You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to 
			  manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or 
			  retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a 
			  vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.
			- The hand can’t attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds.
	- ## Level 1
		- slots_available:: 4
		- **Magic Missile**
		  collapsed:: true
			- level:: 1
			  casting_time:: 1 action
			  range:: 120 feet
			  components:: [[V]], [[S]]
			  duration:: instantaneous
			- You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a 
			  creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 +
			  1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously and 
			  you can direct them to hit one creature or several.
			- *At Higher Levels.* When you cast this spell 
			  using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more 
			  dart for each slot level above 1st.
		- **Disguise Self**
		  collapsed:: true
			- level:: 1
			  casting_time:: 1 action
			  range:: self
			  components:: [[V]], [[S]]
			  duration:: 1 hour
			- You make yourself – including your clothing, armor, weapons, and 
			  other belongings on your person – look different until the spell ends or
			  until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or
			  taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your 
			  body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement 
			  of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
			- The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical 
			  inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your 
			  outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would 
			  feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to 
			  appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to 
			  touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair. To
			  discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to 
			  inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence 
			  (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.
		- **Comprehend Languages**
			- level:: 1
			  casting_time:: 1 action
			  range:: self
			  components:: [[V]], [[S]], [[M]]
			  duration:: 1 hour
			  ritual:: true
			- For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken 
			  language that you hear. You also understand any written language that 
			  you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are 
			  written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.
			- This spell doesn’t decode secret messages in a text or glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn’t part of a written language.
		- **Expeditious Retreat**
		  collapsed:: true
			- level:: 1
			  casting_time:: 1 bonus action
			  range:: self
			  components:: [[V]], [[S]]
			  duration:: 10 minutes
			  concentration:: true
			- This spell allows you to move at an incredible pace. When you cast this 
			  spell, and then as a bonus action on each of your turns until the spell 
			  ends, you can take the Dash action.
		- **Feather Fall**
		  collapsed:: true
			- level:: 1
			  casting_time:: 1 reaction
			  range:: 60 feet
			  components:: [[V]], [[M]]
			  duration:: 1 minute
			- Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature’s 
			  rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If the 
			  creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the spell ends for that creature.
		- **Color Spray**
		  collapsed:: true
			- level:: 1
			  casting_time:: 1 action
			  range:: self (15-foot cone)
			  components:: [[V]], [[S]], [[M]]
			  duration:: 1 round
			- A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. 
			  Roll 6d10, the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can 
			  effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in
			  ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious 
			  creatures and creatures that can’t see).
			- Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, 
			  each creature affected by this spell is blinded until the end of your 
			  next turn. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before 
			  moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s 
			  hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for the 
			  creature to be affected.
			- *At Higher Levels.* When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.
		- **False Life**
		  collapsed:: true
			- level:: 1
			  casting_time:: 1 action
			  range:: self
			  components:: [[V]], [[S]], [[M]]
			  duration:: 1 hour
			- Bolstering yourself with a necromantic facsimile of life, you gain 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points for the duration.
			- *At Higher Levels.* When you cast this spell 
			  using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you gain 5 additional 
			  temporary hit points for each slot level above 1st.
		- **Alarm**
		  collapsed:: true
			- level:: 1
			  casting_time:: 1 minute
			  range:: 30 feet
			  components:: [[V]], [[S]], [[M]]
			  duration:: 8 hours
			  ritual:: true
			- You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window,
			  or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until 
			  the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a tiny or larger creature 
			  touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can 
			  designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You also choose 
			  whether the alarm is mental or audible.
			- A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1
			  mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping. An 
			  audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60
			  feet.
	- ## Level 2
		- slots_available::  2
		- **Suggestion**
		  collapsed:: true
			- level:: 2
			  casting_time:: 1 action
			  range:: 30 feet
			  components:: [[V]], [[M]]
			  duration:: 8 hours
			  concentration:: true
			- You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and 
			  magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear 
			  and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this 
			  effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the 
			  course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, 
			  throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously 
			  harmful act ends the spell.
			- The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it 
			  purses the course of action you described to the best of its ability. 
			  The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If 
			  the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell 
			  ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
			- You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity 
			  during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give 
			  her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn’t met 
			  before the spell expires, the activity isn’t preformed.
			- If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.
		- **Hold Person**
		  collapsed:: true
			- level:: 2
			  casting_time:: 1 action
			  range:: 60 feet
			  components:: [[V]], [[S]], [[M]]
			  duration:: 1 minute
			  concentration:: true
			- Choose a humanoid that you can see within range. The target must 
			  succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At 
			  the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving 
			  throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.
			- *At Higher Levels.* When you cast this spell 
			  using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional
			  humanoid for each slot level above 2nd. The humanoids must be within 30
			  feet of each other when you target them.
